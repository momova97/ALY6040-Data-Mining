# ALY6040 Data Mining - Module 3: Random Forests and Stock Profitability Prediction

## Introduction

In Module 3, I focused on leveraging the random forest technique to address a key business question in our group project: predicting whether a stock will be profitable. This assignment allowed me to apply a robust ensemble learning method to a financial dataset and document the process and results independently, contributing to the collective effort of the project group.

## Assignment Summary

The assignment encompassed several critical stages:

- **Code Walkthrough:** I detailed the steps of how the code processes the data, from loading libraries to preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Analysis:** I conducted an analysis of the dataset, exploring the relationships between variables and utilizing visualizations to enhance the understanding of the data.
- **Interpretation and Recommendations:** I interpreted the outcomes of the random forest model, discussing the implications for stakeholders and suggesting further actions and variables for consideration.

## Key Findings

- The random forest model, with 2000 trees, estimated an error rate of approximately 15%, which is a promising result.
- The best number of variables to try at each split (`mtry`) was determined to be 11, although the adjustment did not significantly alter the model's performance.
- The model's detection rate was not satisfactory, indicating that the random forest did not perform well in this specific instance.

## Next Steps

- Investigating other modeling techniques or parameter tuning to improve the predictive accuracy of the model.
- Incorporating additional relevant variables that could potentially enhance the model's performance, such as market sentiment indicators or macroeconomic factors.

## Reflection

This module's assignment provided a practical application of random forests in a real-world context. Despite the less-than-ideal results, the experience highlighted the importance of model evaluation and the need for iterative refinement in the data mining process. It also underscored the fact that even powerful techniques like random forests can sometimes yield inaccurate predictions, emphasizing the necessity for critical analysis and validation.

Thank you for reviewing my work on the Module 3 assignment of the ALY6040 Data Mining course. The insights gained from this experience will be valuable for future projects and collaborative efforts in the field of data mining.
