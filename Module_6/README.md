# ALY6040 Data Mining - Module 6: Final Project on Stock Performance Prediction

## Executive Summary

In the culmination of our data mining exploration, this final project presents a comprehensive analysis aimed at predicting stock performance. Our team has navigated through a complex dataset, refined it to a critical subset of variables, and applied various predictive models to forecast stock market behavior.

## Project Overview

The project involved several key phases:

- **Outlier Analysis:** We utilized Cook's Distance method to identify and assess the impact of outliers on our predictive models, ensuring the robustness of our results.
- **Sector Variance Analysis:** We examined sector-specific variances, particularly noting significant fluctuations in the utilities sector, which provided valuable insights for our predictive efforts.
- **Model Exploration and Selection:** Our exploration included models such as Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, SVM, and K-Means Clustering, each offering a unique perspective on the prediction task.

## Challenges and Results

One of the primary challenges we faced was the inherent unpredictability of the stock market, which often led to models with high accuracy but low sensitivity. Through perseverance and strategic model tuning, we identified the Naïve Bayes Classifier as the standout model, achieving over 90% accuracy in both training and testing phases. This model provided a balanced approach to stock prediction, distinguishing itself amidst the complexities of financial data.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Our foray into stock prediction has underscored the intricate nature of financial datasets. We recommend future researchers approach data cleaning with caution, as conventional methods may not always align with the erratic behavior of financial markets. The Naïve Bayes Classifier, with its commendable performance, serves as a promising tool for stock prediction, though we acknowledge that there is no one-size-fits-all solution in this domain.

## Further Exploration

We invite you to delve into our dataset and code to explore the nuances of stock prediction further. There may be undiscovered patterns or insights that could enhance the predictive power of the models we've tested.

We extend our gratitude for your interest in our project and hope that the insights gained here will prove valuable in your data mining pursuits within the ALY6040 course and beyond.
