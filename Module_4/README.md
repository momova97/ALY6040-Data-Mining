# ALY6040 Data Mining - Module 4: Support Vector Machines and Blood Donation Prediction

## Introduction

For Module 4, I applied the Support Vector Machines (SVM) technique to predict whether blood donors would donate in March 2007. This assignment involved a series of steps to prepare the data, optimize the SVM model, and validate its performance using a dataset from the Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City, Taiwan.

## Assignment Summary

The assignment included the following key components:

- **Code Walkthrough:** I provided a thorough explanation of the code's interaction with the data, from loading the necessary libraries to preprocessing the dataset.
- **Analysis:** I analyzed the dataset, identifying relationships between variables and using visualizations to support the analysis.
- **Interpretation and Recommendations:** I interpreted the results of the SVM model, offering recommendations for further analysis and suggesting additional variables that could improve the model's predictive power.

## Key Findings

- The SVM model was tuned to find the optimal cost parameter, resulting in a model that performed 30% better than random prediction.
- Sensitivity of the model was high, and specificity was reasonable given the small sample size.
- Influential data points identified using Cook's distance were removed, which significantly improved the model's specificity.

## Next Steps

- Collecting more data to enhance the model's accuracy and robustness.
- Considering stacking models or using ensemble methods to improve predictions.
- Exploring additional variables that could influence donation likelihood, such as demographic factors or historical donation patterns.

## Reflection

This module's assignment provided valuable experience in using SVM for classification tasks. The process of tuning the model and validating its performance offered insights into the nuances of SVM optimization. Despite the challenges posed by a small dataset, the assignment demonstrated the potential of SVM in making meaningful predictions.

Thank you for reviewing my work on the Module 4 assignment of the ALY6040 Data Mining course. The skills and understanding developed through this project will be instrumental in my future data mining projects.
