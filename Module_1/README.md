# ALY6040 Data Mining - Module 1: Data Exploration and Cleaning

## Introduction

Welcome to my exploration of data mining techniques applied to the McDonald's ice cream machine dataset. This module's assignment was an exciting dive into data cleaning and preliminary analysis, where I uncovered interesting patterns and prepared the dataset for future in-depth studies.

## Assignment Summary

The assignment was a multi-step process that involved:

- Installing R and RStudio, along with the necessary packages for data manipulation and visualization.
- Conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to familiarize myself with the dataset's variables, data types, and values.
- Cleaning the data by correcting data types, removing unnecessary variables, and addressing outliers.
- Calculating summary statistics and creating graphs to visualize and gain insights into the data.

## Key Findings

- The dataset consisted of 12,725 entries from the US, with no missing data or duplications, indicating a relatively clean dataset.
- Outliers were identified and handled appropriately, ensuring the integrity of the subsequent analysis.
- The analysis debunked the common myth of frequently broken McDonald's ice cream machines, as most machines were found to be operational.

## Next Steps

- Delving into the psychological aspects behind the persistence of the broken ice cream machine myth.
- Continuing with data cleansing and employing more advanced data mining techniques to extract deeper insights.

## Reflection

This module was a great starting point for understanding the importance of data quality and the role of EDA in the data mining process. It was intriguing to see how data can sometimes contradict popular beliefs and how thorough exploration is crucial in revealing the true story behind the numbers.

Thank you for exploring my work on the Module 1 assignment of the ALY6040 Data Mining course. I look forward to applying the skills learned here to future data-driven projects.
