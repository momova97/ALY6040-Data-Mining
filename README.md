# ALY6040 Data Mining Course Repository

Welcome to the repository for the ALY6040 Data Mining course. This repository contains all the materials, assignments, and projects completed throughout the course. Each module is organized into its own directory, with a dedicated README file that provides an overview of the module's focus and key takeaways.

## Repository Structure

- `Module_1`: Introduction to data mining concepts and initial practice with techniques.
- `Module_2`: Exploration of decision trees and their application in mushroom classification.
- `Module_3`: Application of different data mining techniques to a project dataset.
- `Module_4`: Use of Support Vector Machines for predictive modeling.
- `Module_5`: Text mining and word cloud generation to extract insights from textual data.
- `Module_6`: The final project, which includes a comprehensive report and R scripts, detailing the process of predicting stock performance using various data mining models.

## Old_Files

The `Old_Files` directory contains earlier versions of scripts, project files, and additional resources that were used or referenced during the course. This includes a license file, R scripts for individual modules, project files, and datasets.

## Usage

Each module directory contains a PDF file with the detailed report or practice document and a README.md file summarizing the module's content. The `Module_6` directory includes the final project's R script and PDF report, showcasing the culmination of skills developed during the course.

To explore the course materials, navigate to the respective module directory and review the README.md for an overview. For a deeper dive, open the PDF reports to understand the methodologies, analyses, and conclusions drawn in each module.

## Contributions

This repository is the result of works by Mohammad Hossein Movahedi under the guidance of Dr. Hootan Kamran. It serves as a comprehensive record of the learning and application of data mining techniques in various contexts throughout the ALY6040 course.

Thank you for visiting this repository. We hope the materials and insights shared here will be valuable to fellow students and data mining enthusiasts.
