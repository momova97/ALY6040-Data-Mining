# ALY6040 Data Mining - Module 2: Decision Trees and Mushroom Classification

## Introduction

In Module 2 of the Data Mining course, I tackled the fascinating challenge of classifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous using decision tree analysis. This assignment involved a deep dive into a dataset of mushroom characteristics, where I applied data mining techniques to build a predictive model that can aid in distinguishing safe-to-eat mushrooms.

## Assignment Summary

The assignment was structured into several key sections:

- **Code Walkthrough:** I provided a detailed explanation of how the code interacts with and transforms the data, including examples from the output.
- **Analysis:** I analyzed the data and the relationships between variables, using visualizations to support my findings and gain insights into the characteristics of mushrooms.
- **Interpretation and Recommendations:** I interpreted the results of the analysis, suggesting characteristics that indicate whether a mushroom is safe to eat and making recommendations for further analysis.

## Key Findings

- The decision tree model achieved a perfect classification rate on the test dataset, with 100% sensitivity and specificity.
- The `odor` attribute was the most significant predictor, capable of perfectly classifying a large portion of the dataset.
- The analysis revealed that while some mushroom characteristics are highly indicative of edibility, others do not contribute significantly to the classification.

## Next Steps

- Further analysis could involve examining additional variables that may contribute to mushroom classification, such as geographic location or growth conditions.
- Building other classification models, such as random forests or neural networks, to compare performance and robustness against the decision tree model.

## Reflection

This module's assignment was an excellent opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical problem. The process of building and validating a decision tree model provided valuable insights into the importance of feature selection and model evaluation. It was particularly interesting to see how a single attribute could have such a significant impact on the classification outcome.

Thank you for exploring my work on the Module 2 assignment of the ALY6040 Data Mining course. The skills and knowledge gained here will undoubtedly be beneficial for future data mining endeavors.
